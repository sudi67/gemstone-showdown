###  about the project
The goal of this project is to develop a simple web-based voting system where users can vote for their favorite valuable stone. Using JavaScript and the DOM, the system will allow users to select a stone, submit their vote, and view real-time results. The system must ensure users select a stone before voting and dynamically update the results upon submission.
